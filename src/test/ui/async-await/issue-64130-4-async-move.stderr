error[E0277]: future cannot be sent between threads safely

LL | pub fn foo() -> impl Future + Send {
   |                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ future is not `Send`
   |
   = help: the trait `std::marker::Sync` is not implemented for `(dyn std::any::Any + std::marker::Send + 'static)`
   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `std::marker::Sync` for `std::ptr::Unique<(dyn std::any::Any + std::marker::Send + 'static)>`
   = note: required because it appears within the type `std::boxed::Box<(dyn std::any::Any + std::marker::Send + 'static)>`
   = note: required because it appears within the type `Client`
note: future is not `Send` as this value is used across an await
