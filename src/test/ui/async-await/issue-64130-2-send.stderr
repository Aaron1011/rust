error[E0277]: future cannot be sent between threads safely
  --> $DIR/issue-64130-2-send.rs:21:5

LL | fn is_send<T: Send>(t: T) { }
   |    -------    ---- required by this bound in `is_send`
...
LL |     is_send(bar());
   |     ^^^^^^^ future is not `Send`
   |
   = help: within `impl std::future::Future`, the trait `std::marker::Send` is not implemented for `Foo`
note: future is not `Send` as this value is used across an await
  --> $DIR/issue-64130-2-send.rs:15:5
   |
LL |     let x = Foo;
   |         - has type `Foo`
LL |     baz().await;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^ await occurs here, with `x` maybe used later
LL | }
   | - `x` is later dropped here
   = note: required because it appears within the type `impl std::future::Future`
